Apple announced the new iPad, featuring a stunning new Retina display, new A5X processor with quad-core graphics and a 5 megapixel camera and 1080p HD video.

## Retina Display

This could be the most amazing part of the new iPad. High-resolution screen with a 2048-by-1536-pixel resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi) is potentially the highest resolution tablet in the world.

The new iPad has roughly 1 million or a 51.7% more pixels than a normal Full HD display.

## Apple's A5X Processor

The new A5X chip with quad-core graphics processor is roughly 4 times faster than iPad 2 in order to have the same smoothness and maintain the same incredibly response in iPad 2.

## Battery Life

The new iPad is slightly thicker (around 6.8%) and heavier (around 8.3% - 8.5%) than iPad 2 for this reason. You still get up to 10 hours of power to operate the new iPad.

## iSight Camera

The 5-megapixel iSight camera comes with autofocus, tap to focus, tap to set exposure functions, and built-in face detection. It also lets you capture HD video in full 1080p, with automatic video stabilization. Check [iPad Gallery](http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/) to view photos and videos taken with the new iPad.

## LTE / 4G Support

The new iPad supports fast cellular networks up to 4G LTE, and you still get access to 3G networks. You can also make your new iPad as a personal hotspot now.

## Conclusion

The new iPad pre-orders start today in the Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Switzerland, UK and the US and will be available on Friday, 16 March.
