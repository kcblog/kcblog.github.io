description: Moving to Octopress.

After some hard time considerations and finally made up my mind to move my blog to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). After some configurations, I am really satisfied with the default theme `classic`, the responsive layouts and all the plugins that Octopress included by default.

I am also pushing my codes to [GitHub](https://github.com/kwangchin/kcblog.net) for learning purposes.
